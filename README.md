# SLAM Implementation

###  What is Slam?
SLAM is the computational method for constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of the location within it. For example in autonomous vehicles it lets you build a map and localize your vehicle in that map at the same time. This helps plan things like path planning and obstacle avoidance.

### To Do List:
[ ] Begin with basic object detection with computer vision such as lane detection and sign detection
2. Research
